# Tutorial Round Descriptions

### Round 2

Grey targets are normal targets. Shoot them once and they disappear. Pretty simple, right? \n\nNext, we have Blue targets. Shooting them once will spawn another grey target. Don't get too overwhelmed!

### Round 3

Great job! Next up are red targets. Be wary as shooting them will make you take damage. However, letting them dissipate has no penalty. \n\nBut, shooting them still gives you points. If you're hungry for a high score, shoot them at your own risk. If you have health to spare, give some a shot!

### Round 4

Finally, we have green targets. Shooting these will heal you and give you points. Make sure to prioritize these when you are low on health!

### Round 5

To end this tutorial, we have enabled all the targets. Learning to prioritize your targets is the key to earning a high score and staying alive! Good luck!
