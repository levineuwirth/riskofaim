# Tutorial Round Descriptions

### Round 2

Grey targets are normal targets. Shoot them once and they disappear. Pretty simple, right? \n\nNext, we have Blue targets. Shooting them once will spawn another grey target. Don't get too overwhelmed!

### Round 3

Great job! Next up are red targets. Be wary as shooting them will make you take damage. However, letting them dissipate has no penalty. \n\nBut, shooting them still gives you points. If you're hungry for a high score, shoot them at your own risk. If you have health to spare, give some a shot!

### Round 4

Finally, we have green targets. Shooting these will heal you and give you points. Make sure to prioritize these when you are low on health!

### Round 5

To end this tutorial, we have enabled all the targets. Learning to prioritize your targets is the key to earning a high score and staying alive! Good luck!

### Round 2

Not bad, not bad. Let's make things slightly harder. Time to sprinkle in some blue targets!

## Round 3

Pretty easy so far, right? If you are struggling already, you need to lock in buddy. It only gets harder from here.

## Round 4

Getting nervous? I hope not. If so, to help calm you down, let's add red targets into the mix!

## Round 5

Wow, impressive. You're doing better than I thought. Be careful though: one small slip up could cost you lots of health!

## Round 6

Feeling the heat? They're spawning pretty quickly, huh? To actually help this time, let me introduce some greens into the mix. With, of course, a lot of blues.

## Round 7

Just keep shooting, just keep shooting, I forgot the rest of the lyrics to this tunee.

## Round 8

Oh, you're still here?

## Round 9

Getting a little overwhelmed, aren't ya? If your health is dipping low, make sure to grab those greens. Me personally, I only go for blues. Who needs healing when you're good at the game, am I right?

## Round 10

Okay, final round. It'd be a shame for you to lose here, wouldn't it?
